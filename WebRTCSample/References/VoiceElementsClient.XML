          This is the <see cref="T:VoiceElements.Client.RoutableResource">Routable Resource</see> to which you would like to route.  The resource from which you call this method becomes the first one in the route, the one specified by this

           The RouteFull method routes the transmit timeslots of both resources together.  This will allow a <see cref="T:VoiceElements.Client.RoutableResource">Routable Resource</see>
           to listen to another resource.  It will also allow the other resource to listen to the first resource.<para></para>
           <strong>Routing Resources - When to Use It</strong><para></para>
           This method is used to "connect two callers," or to route a caller to an IVR or application to provide audio.  This method is the cornerstone of the majority of telephony applications, as
            it is the bridge to connect callers and audio.
           <para></para>
           <strong>Full Route vs Half Route</strong><para></para>
           A full route allows both parties to listen to each other, while a <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.RoutableResource.RouteHalf(VoiceElements.Client.RoutableResource)">Half Route</see> will only allow one party to listen to the other.
       This distinction should be decided in each case you want to do a route.
       </remarks><example>
       The example below shows how to route two resources together.  This simple code gets two <see cref="T:VoiceElements.Client.ChannelResource">Channel Resources</see>, then executes a <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.ChannelResource.Dial(System.String)">Dial Method</see> on each
       to place two separate outbound calls and then lastly executes the full route.  Note that typically, you would want to look at <see cref="T:VoiceElements.Common.DialResult">Dial Result</see> before routing, but for simplicity, we only route the calls together below.
          <code lang="cs">
            public static void MakeTwoCallsAndRoute()
            {
                TelephonyServer m_TelephonyServer = new TelephonyServer();// To get a channel, you must first get a link to a Telephony Server.  You may need to pass a username password here.

      Completes a half route between two <see cref="T:VoiceElements.Client.RoutableResource">Routable Resources</see>.  The channel calling this method listens to the one in the parameter, the second cannot hear.

      <para>Routable Resource</para>
      This is the <see cref="T:VoiceElements.Client.RoutableResource">Routable Resource</see> to which you would like to route.  The resource from which you call this method becomes the first one in the route that is listening, the one specified by this
      parameter is the target or second in the route and <strong>does not listen</strong>.
    </param><exception cref="T:System.Exception"></exception><remarks>
      The Route Half method routes the transmit timeslot of the firstg resource to the second.  This will allow a <see cref="T:VoiceElements.Client.RoutableResource">Routable Resource</see>
      to listen to another resource.  It will not allow the other resource to listen to the first resource.<para></para>
      <strong>Routing Resources - When to Use It</strong><para></para>
      This method is used to allow a caller or a resource to listen when you would like the other muted.  Be careful to recognize which you would like to hear and when you should have both listen and do a 
      <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.RoutableResource.RouteFull(VoiceElements.Client.RoutableResource)">Full Route</see>.
      <para></para>
      <strong>Full Route vs Half Route</strong><para></para>
      A <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.RoutableResource.RouteFull(VoiceElements.Client.RoutableResource)">Full Route</see> allows both parties to listen to each other, while a Half Route will only allow one party to listen to the other.
      This distinction should be decided in each case you want to do a route.
    </remarks><example>
      The example below shows how to route two resources together in a hlf route.  This simple code gets two <see cref="T:VoiceElements.Client.ChannelResource">Channel Resources</see>, then executes a <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.ChannelResource.Dial(System.String)">Dial Method</see> on each
      to place two separate outbound calls.  The code then does a <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.RoutableResource.StopListener(VoiceElements.Client.RoutableResource)">Stop Listener</see> so the two channels cannot hear each other, the uses two half routes to have each of them listen to one <see cref="T:VoiceElements.Client.VoiceResource">Voice Resource</see> so a 
      <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.VoiceResource.PlayTTS(System.String)">Text to Speech Play</see> can play a message to both, and then does a <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.RoutableResource.RouteFull(VoiceElements.Client.RoutableResource)">Full Route</see> for the two channels to talk.

      <strong>SIP Addressing</strong><para></para>
      When using <see href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol">SIP</see>, you may substitute the phone number with a SIP address. A SIP URI or specific call destination has many aspects, for details you can read about the
      <see href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol#Protocol_design">SIP URI formats here.</see>  For example, you may specify a user at an IP or domain like: "bugsbunny@127.0.0.1" or "porkypig@loonytunes.com".  If you are new to SIP, you may need to ask your network administrator or 
      experiment to find the right format for your carrier or the network to which you are connecting.<para></para>

          Fires when there is a new inbound call sent from the Voice Elements Server.
    </summary><remarks>
           <strong>You Must Register DNIS's to Receive Calls</strong><para></para>
           Before the Voice Elements Server that handles telephony resources will send new calls to your application and fire this event, you must <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.TelephonyServer.RegisterDNIS">Register DNIS(s)</see>
           with the Voice Elements Server.  If this is not done, the server will not raise New Call Events.  For more information about DNIS, see <see href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNIS">What's a DNIS?</see>  <para></para>
           <strong>Threading and Best Practices</strong><para></para>
           Voice Elements handles creation of a thread behind the scenes before calling this event.  You can spend the entire length of the call in this event, therefore there is no need to quickly exit.
           The simplest approach to designing a simple inbound application is to create a inbound script class and call that class from this event.<para></para>
           <strong>Warning: Always Make That Inbound Script Class</strong><para></para>
           As mentioned above, you may spend all of your time in the new call event, but you should create a new class to handle your call processing.  If you do not do so, your application will answer calls, but be warned that
           the New Call Event is static, so if a second call comes in it will share memore with any currently running calls and can lead to trouble.<para></para>
           <strong>Define your New Call Event in your Start Up Code</strong><para></para>
           Put something like this in your startup code: <c>s_TelephonyServer.NewCall += new VoiceElements.Client.NewCall(s_TelephonyServer_NewCall);</c>  Determine the entry point of your application and
           decide where you would like to begin receiving these events.  You may make this before or after you <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.TelephonyServer.RegisterDNIS">Register DNIS(s)</see>, since the server will
           not even try to raise events until the registration is done.<para></para>
           <strong>Subscribe to Disconnected Events</strong><para></para>
           You should always subscribe to <see cref="E:VoiceElements.Client.ChannelResource.Disconnected">Disconnect Events</see> (aka Hang Ups) immediately upon getting a New Call event.  Always do this unless you explicitly have a reason not to do so.
           The following code line will do this subscription (C#): <c>e.ChannelResource.Disconnected += new Disconnected(ChannelResource_Disconnected);</c>  Determine the entry point of your application and
           decide where you would like to begin receiving these events.  You may make this before or after you <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.TelephonyServer.RegisterDNIS">Register DNIS(s)</see>, since the server will
           not even try to raise events until the registration is done.<para></para>
    </remarks><returns>
           This event comes along with a <see cref="T:VoiceElements.Client.NewCallEventArgs">New Call Argument Object</see>, which contains a reference to the
           <see cref="T:VoiceElements.Client.ChannelResource">Channel Resource</see> that has been assigned for the duration of the new call.  You will use this object along with
           the <see cref="T:VoiceElements.Client.VoiceResource">Voice Resource</see> for all <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.VoiceResource.Play(System.String)">Plays</see>,
           <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.VoiceResource.GetResponse">Get Responses</see> and other voice functions.  To access the Voice Resource, you will find a reference in the
           <see cref="P:VoiceElements.Client.ChannelResource.VoiceResource">Voice Resource Property</see> of the Channel Resource in the NewCallEventArgs.
      
    </returns><example>
           The example below shows a chunk of code that executes when the event arrives.  Notice that the sample immediately begins gathering information from the ChannelResource object reference
           passed in the NewCallEventArgs object "e".  The code then Answers the call, creates and instance of an IVR application class and executes an RunScript method.
           These are created by you and this model is recommended as the simplest way to encapsulate your IVR script.

      If provided by the carrier or network, this is essentially the inbound number dialed by the party who placed the last inbound call.  For more detail, see <see href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNIS">What is a DNIS</see>.  This is typically used for assigning blocks of inbound numbers to different scripts or call flows.  
      in essence, you can write several applications and combine them into one, assigning different inbound numbers or blocks of numbers to each one in a single code base.  you may also want to use DNIS for logging call activity in a database or even
      applying routing or script rules based on the number, area code, prefix that has been called.

      <strong>DNIS's Come in Many Forms</strong><para></para>
      You may find that carriers will only pass the last four or seven numbers as the DNIS.  Also, in a <see href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol">SIP</see> deployment, the DNIS will contain the originating SIP URI.  
      It is always a good idea to run a test in your production environment, log the exact DNIS format coming in and adjust your code accordingly.<para></para>

      Voice Elements uses <see href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF">Tiff</see> graphic files for transport. It is always a good idea to clean up a Tiff file for transport (get the resolution right and more).
      We have provided a simple way to do this using the <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.TelephonyServer.TifToTif(System.String,System.String)">Tiff to Tiff method</see>.  You should call this before transport as shown in the sample code below.<para></para>

      This can be is used as a safety net to ensure that calls do not end up connected for long periods of time.  You can take a setting for maximum call length and calucluate the drop time from the time of the call and set it to ensure all calls stay within

    </summary><remarks>
      The application transfer feature is extremely powerful when used correctly.  You may have separate code bases running on separate systems and move calls between them at any time using the <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.ChannelResource.TransferApplication(System.String,System.String)">Transfer Application Method</see>.  
      In this case, another application has invoked the
      <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.ChannelResource.TransferApplication(System.String,System.String)">Transfer Application Method</see>.  At that point, this "target application" will receive a <see cref="E:VoiceElements.Client.ChannelResource.NewCall">New Call event</see> 
      for the <see cref="P:VoiceElements.Client.ChannelResource.Dnis">DNIS</see> specified by the transferring application and for which the target is <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.TelephonyServer.RegisterDNIS">registered</see>.<para></para>
      <strong>How to get the Transfer Data</strong><para></para>
      Along with the new call comes the data
      stored in the Transfer Data Property for the call in this application.  Being an arbitrary string, you can use delimiters to pass many data fields like phone number, caller id, data already received from the caller, or anything to help the target application process the call. 
      Simply get the property, parse and handle it as you would like.<para></para>

             The server may be specified by a LAN DNS entry, internet url or a specific IP address.  If the server is running on the same machine
             as your client, your may reference it by "localhost:{port}" or by the local ip of "127.0.0.1:{port}".  Voice Elements defaults the port setting
             to port 54331.  For more information on changing these settings on the server, see 
             <see href="http://support.inventivelabs.com/index.php?title=Configuring_Server_General_Application_Behavior">Configuring VE Server General Behavior</see>.

             <example>
            This sample resolves the IP of the server from a DNS address, instantiates a TelephonyServer connection named "s_TelephonyServer"
             and then writes out its url property to a console line.

        <member name="E:VoiceElements.Client.TelephonyServer.NewCall">
            <summary>
        Fires when there is a new inbound call sent from the Voice Elements Server.
      </summary><remarks>
        <strong>You Must Register DNIS's to Receive Calls</strong><para></para>
        Before the Voice Elements Server that handles telephony resources will send new calls to your application and fire this event, you must <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.TelephonyServer.RegisterDNIS">Register DNIS(s)</see>
        with the Voice Elements Server.  If this is not done, the server will not raise New Call Events.  For more information about DNIS, see <see href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNIS">What's a DNIS?</see>  <para></para>
        <strong>Threading and Best Practices</strong><para></para>
        Voice Elements handles creation of a thread behind the scenes before calling this event.  You can spend the entire length of the call in this event, therefore there is no need to quickly exit.
        The simplest approach to designing a simple inbound application is to create a inbound script class and call that class from this event.<para></para>
        <strong>Define your New Call Event in your Start Up Code</strong><para></para>
        Put something like this in your startup code: <c>s_TelephonyServer.NewCall += new VoiceElements.Client.NewCall(s_TelephonyServer_NewCall);</c>  Determine the entry point of your application and
        decide where you would like to begin receiving these events.  You may make this before or after you <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.TelephonyServer.RegisterDNIS">Register DNIS(s)</see>, since the server will
        not even try to raise events until the registration is done.<para></para>
        <strong>Subscribe to Disconnected Events</strong><para></para>
        You should always subscribe to <see cref="E:VoiceElements.Client.ChannelResource.Disconnected">Disconnect Events</see> (aka Hang Ups) immediately upon getting a New Call event.  Always do this unless you explicitly have a reason not to do so.
        The following code line will do this subscription (C#): <c>e.ChannelResource.Disconnected += new Disconnected(ChannelResource_Disconnected);</c>  Determine the entry point of your application and
        decide where you would like to begin receiving these events.  You may make this before or after you <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.TelephonyServer.RegisterDNIS">Register DNIS(s)</see>, since the server will
        not even try to raise events until the registration is done.<para></para>
      </remarks><returns>
        This event comes along with a <see cref="T:VoiceElements.Client.NewCallEventArgs">New Call Argument Object</see>, which contains a reference to the
        <see cref="T:VoiceElements.Client.ChannelResource">Channel Resource</see> that has been assigned for the duration of the new call.  You will use this object along with
        the <see cref="T:VoiceElements.Client.VoiceResource">Voice Resource</see> for all <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.VoiceResource.Play(System.String)">Plays</see>,
        <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.VoiceResource.GetResponse">Get Responses</see> and other voice functions.  To access the Voice Resource, you will find a reference in the
        <see cref="P:VoiceElements.Client.ChannelResource.VoiceResource">Voice Resource Property</see> of the Channel Resource in the NewCallEventArgs.

      </returns><example>
        The example below shows a chunk of code that executes when the event arrives.  Notice that the sample immediately begins gathering information from the ChannelResource object reference
        passed in the NewCallEventArgs object "e".  The code then Answers the call, creates and instance of an IVR application class and executes an RunScript method.
        These are created by you and this model is recommended as the simplest way to encapsulate your IVR script.
        <code lang="cs">
          static void s_TelephonyServer_NewCall(object sender, VoiceElements.Client.NewCallEventArgs e)
          {

          Log.Write("NewCall Arrival! DNIS: {0}  ANI: {1}  Caller ID Name: {2}", e.ChannelResource.Dnis, e.ChannelResource.Ani, e.ChannelResource.CallerIdName);

          // Immediately subscribe to disconnects (hang ups), unles you have a specific reason to not see these events.
          e.ChannelResource.Disconnected += new Disconnected(ChannelResource_Disconnected);

          Log.Write("Answering...");
          // Use the channel resource passed in with the event args to answer the call.
          e.ChannelResource.Answer();

          Log.Write("Calling My IVR Application");
          // Call a class you have created which contains all the scripting and features of the voice interface for the call.
          // You will find that this class will nee references to the Telephony Server, Channel Resource and Log.  You may add more depending on your application.
          MyIVRApplication ivrApp = new MyIVRApplication(s_TelephonyServer, e.ChannelResource, Log);
          // Call a method in your main telephony IVR class to execute your scripts

      Note that <see cref="T:VoiceElements.Client.FaxResource">Fax Resources</see> are limited to the number of Fax licenses you have purchased.  To obtain licenses, contact Inventive Labs sales. <see href="mailto:sales@inventivelabs.com">Email us with this link</see>.<para></para>
      <strong>Use <see href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF">Tiff</see> File Format - Best Practices</strong><para></para>
      Voice Elements uses <see href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF">Tiff</see> graphic files for transport. It is always a good idea to clean up a Tiff file for transport (get the resolution right and more).  
      We have provided a simple way to do this using the <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.TelephonyServer.TifToTif(System.String,System.String)">Tiff to Tiff method</see>.  You should call this before transport as shown in the sample code below.<para></para>
      <strong>Don't Have <see href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF">Tiff</see> Files? Convert Them</strong><para></para>
      Voice Elements uses <see href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF">Tiff</see> graphic files for transport. If you don't have Tiff files to send, we have created simple ways to convert files using 
      the <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.TelephonyServer.JpgToTif(System.String,System.String)">Jpeg to Tiff method</see> and the <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.TelephonyServer.PdfToTif(System.String,System.String)">Pdf to Tiff method</see>.  This is shown in the sample code below.<para></para>
      <strong>Don't Forget the <see cref="T:VoiceElements.Client.FaxResult">Fax Result</see></strong><para></para>
      Although the example below doesn't show this, you may want to switch on the reult and take actions in your application accordingly.

        <strong>Normal vs T.38</strong><para></para>
        Generally, <see href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T.38">T.38</see> is a more reliable protocal and will lead to more successful faxes.  However, most SIP carriers do not support T.38 and it may be difficult to find.  
        Before using T.38 mode, you may want to confirm with your carrier that it is available for your use.<para></para>

        <strong>Supported File Types</strong><para></para>
        Voice Elements supports a wide range of audio file types and formats, for a detailed list of these formats, see <see cref="T:VoiceElements.Common.Codec">Supported Audio Codecs</see>.  Most of these formats that we recommend
        are <see href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_file">Wave Files</see>.  You may need to convert your audio into one of these formats, depending on the source.<para></para> 
        <strong>Telephony Sound Processing: Audio Quality</strong><para></para>
        Before discussing converting your audio files, we need to point out that all audio transmitted over a telephony carrier is typically converted down to 8khz 8bit Mulaw (aka G711) quality in transmission (some countries use ALaw, and in addition to G711, G729 is also another codec that can be used).  Therefore, higher quality files will not result in
        a better sounding connection.  We also recommend converting your files to this codec to save conversion before tranmission every time.  To play files of a different type, you may change the <see cref="P:VoiceElements.Client.VoiceResource.Codec">Voice Resource Codec Property</see> 
        to any of the supported codecs.<para></para>
        <strong>Converting Your Audio Files</strong><para></para>
        There are several applications available that you can easily use to convert to 8khz 8bit Mulaw format from almost any other format. We have had good results with <see href="http://www.goldwave.com">GoldWave</see>, <see href="http://www.nch.com.au/wavepad/index.html">WavePad</see> 
        and <see href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Open Source Audacity</see>. If you need to convert your files in real time (i.e. during a call), we recommend <see href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/">Open Source SOX</see>.<para></para>
      <strong>FAQ: Audio Doesn't Sound Clear?</strong><para></para>
        This is usually a codec mismatch.  Either convert your files or change the <see cref="P:VoiceElements.Client.VoiceResource.Codec">Voice Resource Codec Property</see> to the one in which your files were encoded.<para></para>
      <strong>FAQ: Can I Use MP3 Files?</strong><para></para>
        Voice Elements does not support MP3 files, which are usually in a far higher quality than needed for telephony.  See above on ways to convert your files to 8khz 8bit Mulaw.<para></para>

        Most developers will opt to use the <see cref="M:VoiceElements.Client.VoiceResource.Play(System.String)">Direct File Play Method</see> to play audio.  As you can see in the code sample below, you can easily take a file and turn it into 
        a <see cref="T:System.IO.FileStream">File Stream</see> and put that into an array of bytes and execute the play.  However, most often this method is used by those who desire to store their audio in a database as a 
        <see href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object">BLOB Data Type</see> and stream it right from there.<para></para>
        <strong>General Concepts:  Audio in Voice Elements and Telephony</strong><para></para>
        Voice Elements supports a wide range of audio file types and formats, for a detailed list of these formats, see <see cref="T:VoiceElements.Common.Codec">Supported Audio Codecs</see>.  Most of these formats that we recommend
        are <see href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_file">Wave Files</see>.  You may need to convert your audio into one of these formats, depending on the source.<para></para>

            <strong>Telephony Sound Processing: Audio Quality</strong><para></para>
            Before discussing converting your audio files, we need to point out that all audio transmitted over a telephony carrier is typically converted down to 8khz 8bit Mulaw (aka G711) quality in transmission (some countries use ALaw, and in addition to G711, G729 is also another codec that can be used).  Therefore, higher quality files will not result in
            a better sounding connection.  We also recommend converting your files to this codec to save conversion before tranmission every time.  To play files of a different type, you may change the <see cref="P:VoiceElements.Client.VoiceResource.Codec">Voice Resource Codec Property</see>
            to any of the supported codecs.

            <strong>Converting Your Audio Files</strong><para></para>
            There are several applications available that you can easily use to convert to 8khz 8bit Mulaw format from almost any other format. We have had good results with <see href="http://www.goldwave.com">GoldWave</see>, <see href="http://www.nch.com.au/wavepad/index.html">WavePad</see>
            and <see href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Open Source Audacity</see>. If you need to convert your files in real time (i.e. during a call), we recommend <see href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/">Open Source SOX</see>.

        When playing tones, you control <see href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_frequency">Frequency</see>, Amplitude(volume), and duration of the tone.  Below are the valid ranges and suggestions for each.
        <list type="bullet">
          <item>
            Frequency should range from 100 to 3000.  The higher the number, the higher the "pitch" of the tone.
          </item>
          <item>
            Amplitude can be from -1 to -20, but we strongly suggest for telephony applications to always use -17.
          </item>
          <item>
            Duration is up to you and your tone needs, the value is in milliseconds.

        Note that many of these tones are played repeatedly with differing amounts of silence in between.  You will need to loop and for example do a <c>Thread.Sleep(4000)</c> for four seconds of silence.  Se the code sample below for more detail.
